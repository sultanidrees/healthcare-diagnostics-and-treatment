🏥 Healthcare Diagnostics and Treatment Using Computer Vision and AI

This project aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and optimize treatment planning using real-time computer vision and machine learning. By analyzing medical images (like X-rays, MRIs, CT scans) and patient data, the system assists in early disease detection and suggests appropriate treatment paths. This improves diagnosis speed, reduces errors, and supports healthcare professionals in delivering timely and personalized care.

📌 Features • 🧠 Disease Detection using AI-powered image classification (YOLO, TensorFlow, or similar) • 📸 Real-time image analysis from medical imaging devices • 📊 Smart Diagnosis based on image data and patient history • 💾 Logs and visualizes diagnostic data for ongoing patient monitoring • 🌐 Scalable for multi-specialty integration (e.g., radiology, dermatology, pathology)

⸻

🛠 Technologies Used • Python • OpenCV • YOLO / TensorFlow / any preferred image classification model • NumPy / Pandas • Flask (optional: for web dashboard/API for healthcare providers) • Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano (optional: for edge deployment in rural/low-resource clinics)

⸻

📷 How It Works 1. Capture Input: Acquire images from medical imaging devices or databases. 2. Detect Conditions: Use trained AI models to identify diseases, anomalies, or risk factors. 3. Analyze and Recommend: Based on detection results and medical data, recommend possible diagnoses and treatments. 4. Assist Professionals: Provide insights to doctors for confirmation or further investigation. 5. Repeat in Real-Time: Continuously improve with new data and update recommendations dynamically.
